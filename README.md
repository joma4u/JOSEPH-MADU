QUESTION 3: TWO LIMITATION CRITERIA OF RESOURCES IN THE FREE TIER
1.	There are limitations based on the how much of a resource you utilise as there are restrictions on the amount of a particular resource you can consume e.g., a specific number of virtual machine hour (750hours for the B1s VM being used in this exercise); a limited amount of storage space and restricted database usage.
2.	There are limitations on the type of services or features within those services that are available in the free tier, this includes certain advanced or specialized features, performance restrictions and other services restricted due to limitation based on regional availability on which the free tier is based.
